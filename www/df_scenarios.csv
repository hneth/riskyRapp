2;Cab problem;en;A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night.  Two companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. You are given the following data: A witness identified the cab as Blue.  The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors at 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.  85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.

3;Hemoccult test;en;To diagnose colorectal cancer, the hemoccult test --- among others --- is conducted to detect occult blood in the stool. This test is used from a particular age on, but also on routine screening for early detection of colorectal cancer. Imagine you conduct a screening using the hemoccult test in a certain region. For symptom-free people over 50 years old who participate in screening using the hemoccult test, the following information is available for this region:   (A) Conditional probabilities format:  The probability that one of these people has colorectal cancer is 0.3 percent. If a person has colorectal cancer, the probability is 50 percent that he will have a positive hemoccult test. If a person does not have colorectal cancer, the probability is 3 percent that he will still have a positive hemoccult test. Imagine a person (over age 50, no symptoms) who has a positive hemoccult test in your screening. What is the probability that this person actually has colorectal cancer?   (B) Natural frequencies format:  Thirty out of every 10,000 people have colorectal cancer. Of these 30 people with colorectal cancer, 15 will have a positive hemoccult test. Of the remaining 9970 people without colorectal cancer, 300 will still have a positive hemoccult test.

4;Mammography;en;A reporter for a women's monthly magazine would like to write an article about breast cancer.  As a part of her research, she focuses on mammography as an indicator of breast cancer.  She wonders what it really means if a woman tests positive for breast cancer during her routine mammography examination.  She has the following data: The probability that a woman who undergoes a mammography will have breast cancer is 1%.  If a woman undergoing a mammography has breast cancer, the probability that she will test positive is 80%.  If a woman undergoing a mammography does not have cancer, the probability that she will test positive is 10%.

5;Mammography (freq);en;10 out of every 1000 women at age 40 who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.  8 out of every 10 women with breast cancer will get a positive mammography.  95 out of every 990 women without breast cancer will also get a positive mammography.

9;PSA test (baseline);en;Now let us consider using the same screening test when prostate cancer is a low-base-rate event.  If the test is used to screen the general population of males, the base rate will be much lower than the 50% depicted in Table 1.  In one of the largest studies of prostate-cancer screening (Schroeder et al., 2009), the base rate of prostate cancer was only 6.3%.  Table 2 depicts this low-base-rate situation.  Now the positive predictive value is down to 19%. This means that 81% of the positive test results are false positives!  Many of the men with these positive test results will have biopsies with associated morbidity (Loeb et al., 2011).  Some of these men will have prostatectomies, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy with their associated morbidities (Chou et al., 2011).  The problem is that a test with modest sensitivity or specificity is not appropriate for screening the general population unless the cost of false positives or false negatives is very low.;Males (general population);Prostate cancer;ill;healthy;PSA-Test;positive test;negative test;TP;FN;FP;TN;0,063;0,21;0,94;0,06;1000;Arkes & Gaissmaier (2012), p. 550;Arkes, H.

10;PSA test (patients);en;With a cutoff point of 4 ng/ml, the PSA test is reported to have a sensitivity of approximately 21% and a specificity of approximately 94% (Thompson et al., 2005).  That means the PSA test will correctly classify 21% of the men with prostate cancer and 94% of the men who do not have prostate cancer.  Conversely, the test will miss about 79% of the men who actually have prostate cancer, and raise a false alarm in 6% of the men who actually do not have prostate cancer. Suppose that this test is given to 1,000 patients at a urology clinic who have symptoms diagnostic of prostate cancer.  Perhaps 50% of these men truly have prostate cancer. Table 1 depicts this situation.  Of the 135 men who test positive, 105 actually have prostate cancer.  Thus, the positive predictive value of the PSA test in this situation is approximately 78% (i.e., 105/135 _ 100).;Male patients with symptoms;Prostate cancer;ill;healthy;PSA-Test;positive test;negative test;TP;FN;FP;TN;0,5;0,21;0,94;0,06;1000;Arkes & Gaissmaier (2012), p. 550;Arkes, H.

11;Psylicraptis screening;en;"A device has been invented for screening a population for a disease known as psylicrapitis. The device is a very good one, but not perfect. If someone is a sufferer, there is a 90 percent chance that he will be recorded positively. If he is not a sufferer, there is still a 1 percent chance that he will be recorded positively. Roughly 1 percent of the population has the disease. Mr. Smith has been tested, and the result is positive. The chance that he is in fact a sufferer is (blank space)?  (p. 213)
Think of 100 people. One has the disease psylicrapitis, and he is likely to test positive. Of those 99 who do not have the disease, 1 will also test positive. How many of those who test positive do have the disease? (p. 214)

12;Sepsis;en;You are working in an outpatient clinic where the record shows that during the past year 10% of the walk-in patients have had sepsis.  A patient walkes in with high fever abd chills, and you also note that he has skin lesions.  According to the records:  If a patient has sepsis, there is an 80% chance that he or she will have these symptoms.  If a patient does not have sepsis, there is still a 10% chance that he or she will show these symptoms.
